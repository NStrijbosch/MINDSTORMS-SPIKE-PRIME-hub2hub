# Robot Inventor and Spike Prime hub2hub communication via BLE

The `hub2hub` library in this project allows the hubs from the LEGO MINDSTORMS Robot Inventor (51515) and LEGO Education SPIKE Prime (45678) sets to directly communicate with each other via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The main goal of this library is to simplifies the python code to setup and maintain a BLE connection between hubs in contrast to the low-level `ubluetooth` library available in the official firmare. Installation of the library and writing programs that exploit it can all be done via the offical LEGO Education SPIKE Prime app.
